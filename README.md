# IOS-Flowgrammer
a graphical programming interface for building programs graphically using a flow diagram style programming interface

this is/was a for fun project to try and create a simple visual programming interface. I was able to create some simple programs
as well as some boolean logic simulators

#Simple Logic Simulations
##SR Latch Example

use boolean variables to connect logic blocks,  not, or/nor/xor/xnor, and/nand blocks.

#Simple Programs
##Print (UIAlertView) Loop Example

use boolean variables to enable the loop (or an number variable for a count loop)
use text variables to set the alert message, (title and description)

#Sensors/Inputs
##Microphone power sensor

use number variables to hold sensor values
